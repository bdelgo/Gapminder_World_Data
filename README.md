**Project Description**
============================================
> In this Analysis of Gapminder data, I will compare different countries and different regions of the world around variables like population, median-age, life expectancy and income in 2015(the last year of available data). I will also look at the distribution of some of this variables among the selected group of countries again in 2015. In addition, and with focus on top 10 countries based on HDI index in 2011, I will take a specific look at the efficiency of the health system in them based on their both governmental and total health spending from 1995 to 2010.

> These are the main questions that I am trying to answer in this project:

> How is the distribution of the 'Population', 'Median Age', 'Life Expectancy' and 'Income' over World Countries in 2015?
> What is the state of different regions of the world based on 'Median Age', 'Life Expectency', 'Income' and 'HDI'?
> What is the trend of health expenditure from 1995 to 2010 for top countries in 2011 HDI index? Is there any significant difference with > respect to health expenditure among these countries?

> You can find Python code and complete step by step description in the included
> [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bdelgo/Udacity_GapminderWorld_Project/blob/master/EDA_of_Gapminder_dataset.ipynb) file.
